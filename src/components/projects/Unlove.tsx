        </p>
      </div>
      <p className={"mb-5"}>
        The title [UN]Love encapsulates the duality of love's presence and
        absence. The prefix “UN” evokes themes of loss, unrequited love, and the
        experience of being unloved, while the brackets suggest that love can
        exist in various forms—conditional, unconditional, or even absent
        entirely. This dichotomy reflects love's complexity and its ability to
        persist, transform, or unravel in different contexts.
      </p>
      <p className={"mb-5"}>
        [UN]Love is a solo harp project that delves into the complexities of
        love through the voices of historically underrepresented female
        composers. Love has always been a central theme in art, but its
        narratives have often been shaped through a singular lens—predominantly
        male perspectives, focusing on themes such as heartbreak, scorn, or
        tragedy.
      </p>
      <p className={"mb-5"}>
        This project aims to amplify alternative perspectives: maternal love,
        the origins and fragility of love, female grief, and the ways women are
        loved and viewed.
      </p>
      <p className={"mb-5"}>
        The harp, historically associated with elegance, femininity, and
        refinement, has long been tied to specific cultural images—graceful
        women performing in French salons, or angelic figures in romanticized
        heavenly portrayals. While iconic, this image has also limited the
        instrument's perception and the scope of its repertoire. Traditionally
        viewed as an instrument of beauty and delicacy, the harp's potential for
        power, versatility, and modern expression has often been overlooked.
      </p>
      <p className={"mb-5"}>
        In 2025, this traditional association is evolving. The harp is
        increasingly being used as a vehicle for bold, innovative works that
        challenge its conventional image, with composers and performers pushing
        its boundaries in both technique and repertoire. Through [UN]LOVE, I aim
        to contribute to this transformation by exploring and showcasing how the
        harp can embody a wide range of emotions and narratives. This project
        highlights the harp's role in reimagining its identity—not just as an
        emblem of grace but as a powerful medium for storytelling.
      </p>
      <p className={"mb-5"}>
        Through this project, I will independently release recordings for four
        works, three of which will be premiere recordings, distributed on major
        streaming platforms including Spotify and Apple Music.
      </p>
      <div className="mb-5">
        <p className="font-semibold mb-2">The repertoire includes:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
          <li>
            A commissioned work from the Park Lane Group, supported by the
            Vaughan Williams Foundation in 2019.
          </li>
          <li>
            An arrangement of a piano work by a prominent British female
            composer.
          </li>
          <li>
            An unpublished and unrecorded work from 1912 by one of the most
            eminent harpists and composers of the 20th century.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p className={"mb-5"}>
        Each piece in [UN]LOVE will be accompanied by visually poignant videos
        filmed in locations that resonate with the style, emotion, and story of
        the music. This approach not only highlights the music but also broadens
        its reach across multiple platforms, creating a more immersive and
        accessible experience.
      </p>
      <p className={"mb-5"}>
        Inspired by James Rhodes' Live in Brighton, I will include bonus
        speaking tracks with each release in the [UN]LOVE project. These tracks
        aim to create a personal and intimate listening experience by sharing
        the stories behind the music—whether exploring the composer's
        background, the themes of love within the piece, or the journey that
        brought it into my repertoire. My goal is to deepen the listener's
        connection to the music by revealing the human stories and emotions
        intertwined with it.
      </p>
      <p className={"mb-5"}>
        Beyond personal storytelling, these speaking tracks serve to make the
        music more accessible to a wider audience. By demystifying the pieces
        and explaining their significance in an approachable way, I hope to
        bridge the gap between performer and listener, inviting people from all
        backgrounds to engage with these works. They also capture the artistic
        intent and cultural context of each piece, offering future listeners
        valuable insight into the evolution of the harp's repertoire and the
        narratives that shaped [UN]LOVE.
      </p>
      <p className={"mb-5"}>
        Incorporating spoken tracks transforms this project into more than just
        an album—it becomes a dialogue, a shared exploration of love, music, and
        the stories we tell through art. I hope it creates a lasting connection
        not just to the music, but to the creative journey behind it.
      </p>
      <b>Why?</b>
      <p className={"mb-5"}>
        After a decade of performing new music without recording it, I've come
        to appreciate the importance of preserving these works—not just for
        myself, but for anyone who might find meaning in them. Each piece in
        this project holds a deep significance for me, whether because of the
        moments it represents in my life or the unique circumstances that
        brought it into existence.
      </p>
      <p className={"mb-5"}>
        This project is not simply about creating an audio legacy—it's about
        sharing the stories and emotions that have shaped me as an artist. It's
        my way of ensuring that these works, and the feelings they evoke,
        continue to inspire and connect with others long into the future.
      </p>
      <p className={"mb-5"}>
        This deliberate effort seeks to preserve and revitalize compositions
        that might otherwise be lost to the repertoire, diversifying and
        enriching the future of harp music.
